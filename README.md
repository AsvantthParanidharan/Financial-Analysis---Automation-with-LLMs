# Financial-Analysis---Automation-with-LLMs
In this project, I learned how to leverage large language models (LLMs) to automate financial analysis. I learned how to perform RAG over a financial dataset, use LLMs to generate financial reports, scrape websites, and extract sentiment from news articles. I learned how to regenerate prompts, dynamically route models, and generate structured outputs.
